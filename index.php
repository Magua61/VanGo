          </p>
          <p>
            1. What is VanGo?
            <br>
            VanGo is an online platform that connects drivers with customers who want to rent a van for various
            purposes. Whether you need a van for a road trip, moving, or any other adventure, VanGo makes it easy to find
            the perfect van to rent.
            <br>
            2. How does VanGo work?
            <br>
            As a van owner, you can list your van on VanGo, providing all the necessary details such as location,
            availability, and rental rates. On the other hand, if you're looking to rent a van, you can browse through the
            available listings, make booking requests, and proceed with the rental transaction.
            <br>
            3. Do I need an account to use VanGo?
            <br>
            Yes, you need to create an account to access the full features of VanGo. Account creation is simple and allows
            you to personalize your experience as either a van renter or owner.
            <br>
            4. Is my personal information safe on VanGo?
            <br>
            We take data security seriously and employ industry-standard measures to protect your personal information.

            5. How do I list my van for rent on VanGo?
            <br>
            To list your van, you must first create an account as a Driver. After that, you can log in to your account
            and follow the steps to create your van listing. Make sure to include
            accurate and detailed information about your van to attract potential renters.
            <br>
            6. Can I set my own rental rates and availability?
            <br>
            Absolutely! As a van owner, you have full control over setting your rental rates and deciding when your van is
            available for rent. You can update this information at any time through your account settings.
            <br>
            7. How do I manage rental requests and bookings?
            <br>
            When a potential renter sends a booking request for your van, you will receive a notification. You can review
            the request and accept or decline it based on your van's availability and your preferences. Once you accept a
            booking, you can communicate with the renter to finalize the details.

            the van's specifications, rental rates, and any additional fees. Also,

            <br>
